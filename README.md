# BufferOverflowExploiting

A script to help you exploiting buffer overflow. It will fuze to get the size of the buffer, and putting your shellcode at the right place.
The only thing left to do is find the correct address.

	 - `var=$((something))`

## Features

 - Little and Big endian, aswell as an automatic detection of endianness
 - Debug mode that launch gdb. Can also be launched without the environment variables
 - 32 or 64 bits support
 - Accept shellcode input as string or file, also contain default shellcodes
 - Verbose mode
